This is a recruitment-process front-end "homework".

The "info-boxes" on the graph should appear on hover, but I wanted the buttons to be somehow functionable so they do the on-click trick.
It was also easier for me to attach the script to the buttons as I'm still learning JS.

I made the boxes disappear on hover instead.

There's no RWD done because I worked with SVG for the first time and there wasn't enough time to make it impeccable.

I need to think which is the best way to make it responsive without having to construct the graph again.
