# Dashboard Frontend Homework
I've never worked with SVG graphics in HTML before, so it took me a few hours to make it look presentable.
The "info-boxes" on the graph should appear on hover, but I wanted the buttons to be somehow functionable so they do the on-click trick.
It was also easier for me to attach the script to the buttons as I'm still learning JS.
I made the boxes disappear on hover instead.
There's no RWD done.
I'm aware this work is not perfect. I'll try to make it impeccable as soon as I can.
